// Javascript is a loosely typed language, which means that you don't have to declare the type of a variable when you declare it.
// The type will be determined automatically at runtime.
// The type of a variable can change during the execution of a program.


// Variables can be declared using the var, let, or const keywords.
// The var keyword is function-scoped, while the let and const keywords are block-scoped.

// var variable1 = "hello"
// keyword name = value
